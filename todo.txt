TODO:

[x] finish applicative and monad instances for parser

[x] add comment parser

[x] add string parser

[x] add eof parser combinator + add eof token type

[x] read from file (in main) and run parser ~> need to abstract over that with CLI flags

[x] somehow store the line number ~> State

[x] unify the way of printing lexemes and errors

[x] apply maximal munch and FCFS somewhere ~> (<+>)

[] fix notOneOf parser combinator

[x] fix Show for LexemeTag

[x] handle tab width for changes in position offset

[x] initial values for PosState

[?] escape sequences

[x] eq: = or ==?

[] don't combine errors using <>

[x] run parser for each lexeme individually and store in a stream

[] add flags for outputting lexer info and potentially setting the tab width

[] inject errors properly

[x] fix invalid symbol error injection (could probably peek into the stream)

[x] fix pre-incrementation of newlines

[x] store errors in lexemes directly

[x] ditch the Result ADT

[x] "\" ~> "\\" ; gets escaped

[x] control sequences get converted to hex

[x] nested comments

[x] one-line comments using --

[?] strings! :(

[] potentially fix things like offsets, etc. newlines seem
   to work properly, but im not sure that the absolute offset/column number
   should be the ones where the lexeme ends?

[x] will there always be exactly one eof token at the end of the token stream?
   or have i messed something up? use filter when outputting :D

[] remove all the completed/useless things in the above list.
   i swear i will eventually, i have attachment issues

[] some files have a newline at the end (dunno if my editor added them or what)
   which is not in the output files that contain the expected output :D:D:D
   which is weird, bc hexdump -c <filename> also shows a newline at the end, so idk

[] a few tests break bc of String contains unescaped newline error.
   the line number should be n-1, dunno why. can fix easily using
   some dirty hacks, but will look at it more carefully

[] fix escape sequences and string too long errors
