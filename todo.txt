[x] typechecking for Parenthesised

[] fix typechecking for equal (needs to support all atomic types)

[] typechecking for static and dynamic dispatch

[] typechecking for NoExpr (this might be a let/attr thing?)

[] typechecking for CaseOf

[] typechecking for Let (might need to modify the tree)

[] typechecking for methods

[] typechecking for attributes

[] typechecking for classes (occurs-check)

[] SELF_TYPE stuff

[] proper conversion of inferred types to their respective
   ADT representation. for example, lub [<some_types>]
   returns a ByteString, which is not ideal since
   the lub might happen to be Int, which is represented
   as NumberType internally. this might cause problems
   where comparison of types is needed. not sure how to
   properly do it due to existential type variables...

[x] finish applicative and monad instances for parser

[x] add comment parser

[x] add string parser

[x] add eof parser combinator + add eof token type

[x] read from file (in main) and run parser ~> need to abstract over that with CLI flags

[x] somehow store the line number ~> State

[x] unify the way of printing lexemes and errors

[x] apply maximal munch and FCFS somewhere ~> (<+>)

[] fix notOneOf parser combinator

[x] fix Show for LexemeTag

[x] handle tab width for changes in position offset

[x] initial values for PosState

[?] escape sequences

[x] eq: = or ==?

[] don't combine errors using <>

[x] run parser for each lexeme individually and store in a stream

[] add flags for outputting lexer info and potentially setting the tab width

[] inject errors properly

[x] fix invalid symbol error injection (could probably peek into the stream)

[x] fix pre-incrementation of newlines

[x] store errors in lexemes directly

[x] ditch the Result ADT

[x] "\" ~> "\\" ; gets escaped

[x] control sequences get converted to hex

[x] nested comments

[x] one-line comments using --

[?] strings! :(

[] potentially fix things like offsets, etc. newlines seem
   to work properly, but im not sure that the absolute offset/column number
   should be the ones where the lexeme ends?

[x] will there always be exactly one eof token at the end of the token stream?
   or have i messed something up? use filter when outputting :D

[] remove all the completed/useless things in the above list.
   i swear i will eventually, i have attachment issues

[] some files have a newline at the end (dunno if my editor added them or what)
   which is not in the output files that contain the expected output :D:D:D
   which is weird, bc hexdump -c <filename> also shows a newline at the end, so idk

[] a few tests break bc of String contains unescaped newline error.
   the line number should be n-1, dunno why. can fix easily using
   some dirty hacks, but will look at it more carefully

[] fix escape sequences and string too long errors
